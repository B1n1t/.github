# B1n1t

Writing codes is simillar to talking to a machine. Machine gets the instruction then works on defined logic.
It has been since the start of computing, and in this age of computational power B1n1t provides
applications that are fun to build and surprisingly interesting to interact - **WELCOME to B1n1t**
