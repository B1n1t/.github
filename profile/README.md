# B1n1t

Writing codes is simillar to talk to a machine. Machine gets the instruction and work on defined logic.
It has been since the start of computing, and in this age of computational power B1n1t provides
applications that are fun to build and surprisingly interestting to interact - **WELCOME in B1n1t**
